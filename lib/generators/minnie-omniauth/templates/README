===============================================================================

Congratulations! You've now set up Minnie for your OmniAuth authentication.

If you're just starting out, here's a few more things you can do:

  1. Set up your User model for OmniAuth.  Just add this to your User model:

       class User < ActiveRecord::Base
         include Minnie:Auth:OmniAuth

  2. Ensure you have set up your provider's callback in config/routes.rb
     For example:

       match '/auth/:provider/callback', to: 'sessions#create'

     Replace :provider with the name of the OmniAuth strategy you're using.

  3. Update your user model to support the extra OmniAuth fields. Something
     like this should work:

       bundle exec rails g migration uid:string name:string username:string
         access_token:string access_token_secret:string

     Be careful with validations - only uid and name are required by
     OmniAuth.
